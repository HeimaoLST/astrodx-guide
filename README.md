## General
### How do I download the game on iOS?
Join the public [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/rACTLjPL) ![AstroDX TestFlight status](https://img.shields.io/badge/testflight-full-red).

Due to AstroDX's popularity, the TestFlight is very often full. However, inactive testers
are periodically cleared, so regularly watch out for open spots!

<!-- 
full = "https://img.shields.io/badge/testflight-full-red"
closed = "https://img.shields.io/badge/testflight-closed-yellow"
open = "https://img.shields.io/badge/testflight-open-green"
 -->

## Settings
### How do I edit settings?
Settings menu is not yet implemented, so you will need to edit `settings.json` manually:
- iOS: Files -> `AstroDX/settings.json`
- Android: `Android/data/com.Reflektone.AstroDX/files/settings.json`

I recommend using a dedicated JSON editor such as [Jayson](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jayson/id1447750768) (iOS)
and [JSON Genie](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tuyware.jsongenie&hl=en&gl=US) (Android) to
prevent common mistakes when manually editing.
